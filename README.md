# to-do-list

I coded a to do list, where you can add, check and delete an element. The current status of the list will be saved in the browser's local storage.

I decided to create this to do list based on the template-tag. To me it was the most elegant option as the checkbox and the delete button would be created automatically everytime a template item would be added.
